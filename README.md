This package consists of three static classes: StringUtilities, ArrayUtilites, and MathUtilities. 
They were designed to apply to logic specifically when working with strings, arrays, and math. Pre-written methods to make your life easier.

(description): This package contains a multitude of functions that either find something or alter something about/from an array.  This can vary from adding every number an array up or sorting them in some way.  Every function included has one overload that uses double inputs/results while the orignals use integer inputs/results

(Method 1 Average): This function finds the average of an array by finding the sum and then dividing it by the total, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 5.  

(Method 2 Max): This function finds the highest number within an array.  Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 8.  

(Method 3 Min): This function finds the lowest number within an array, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 2

(Method 4 SortAscending): Takes in an array input and sorts it in ascending order, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.  

(Method 5 SortDescending): Takes in an array input and sorts it in descending order, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2.  

(Method 6 Sum): Takes in an array input and finds the sum of all elements, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 32.  

(Method 7 Product): Takes in an array input and finds the product of all elements, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 13440.  

(Method 8 SetAllMin): Takes in an array input and sets every element to the minimum of the array, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2.  

(Method 9 SetAllMax): Takes in an array input and sets every element to the maximum of the array, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8.  

(Method 10 AbsoluteValue): Takes in an array input and adds up the absolute value of every element meaning any negative elements are turned postive and then added, Ex. -8, 2, 7, 4, -5, 6 would return 32.
