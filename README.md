This package consists of three static classes: StringUtilities, ArrayUtilites, and MathUtilities. 
They were designed to apply to logic specifically when working with strings, arrays, and math. Pre-written methods to make your life easier.

ArrayUtilities.cs - 


(description): This package contains a multitude of functions that either find something or alter something about/from an array.  This can vary from adding every number an array up or sorting them in some way.  Every function included has one overload that uses double inputs/results while the orignals use integer inputs/results

(Method 1 Average): This function finds the average of an array by finding the sum and then dividing it by the total, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 5.  

(Method 2 Max): This function finds the highest number within an array.  Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 8.  

(Method 3 Min): This function finds the lowest number within an array, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 2

(Method 4 SortAscending): Takes in an array input and sorts it in ascending order, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.  

(Method 5 SortDescending): Takes in an array input and sorts it in descending order, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2.  

(Method 6 Sum): Takes in an array input and finds the sum of all elements, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 32.  

(Method 7 Product): Takes in an array input and finds the product of all elements, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 13440.  

(Method 8 SetAllMin): Takes in an array input and sets every element to the minimum of the array, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2.  

(Method 9 SetAllMax): Takes in an array input and sets every element to the maximum of the array, Ex. 8, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 would return 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8.  

(Method 10 AbsoluteValue): Takes in an array input and adds up the absolute value of every element meaning any negative elements are turned postive and then added, Ex. -8, 2, 7, 4, -5, 6 would return 32.  


-----------------------------
MathUtilites.cs - 


(description): This part of the package is Math-Focused, allowing you to Add, Subtract, Divide, and Multiply; As well as offering other functions like finding the Minimum of two Integers, the Maximum of two Integers, showing you the Absolute Value of an Integer, and even multiplication of one Integer to the Power of another Integer.

(Method 1 Add): Takes in two Integers and adds them together. Ex. 2, 5 would return 7.

(Method 2 Subtract): Takes in two Integers and subtracts them. Ex. 7, 5 would return 2.

(Method 3 Divide): Takes in two Integers and divides them. Ex. 6, 3 would return 2.

(Method 4 Multiply): Takes in two Integers and multiplies them. Ex. 2, 3 would return 6.

(Method 5 Min): Takes in two Integers and returns the lower of the two. Ex. 3, 4 would return 3.

(Method 6 Max): Takes in two Integers and return the higher of the two. Ex. 3, 4 would return 4.

(Method 7 AbsoluteValue): Takes in an Integer and returns its absolute value. Ex. 3 would return -3

(Method 8 Power): Takes in two Integers and multiplies the first by the power of the secod. Ex. 2, 5 would return 32.

(Method 9 MultiStepAll): Takes in five Integers and adds, subtracts, divides, and multiplies them, in that order. Ex. 2, 5, 3, 4, 6 would return 7.

(Method 10 MultiStepAddSubtract): Takes in three Integers and adds the first two Integers, then subtracts the result by the last Integer. Ex. 2, 3, 4 would return 1.

(Method 11 MultiStepDivideMultiply): takes in three Integers and Divides the first two Integers, then multiplies the result by the last Integer, Ex. 6, 3, 4 would return 8.
